# ICT-4510-Advanced-Web-Design-and-Management: Module 2 (Forms) with JavaScript Output 9/12/17

This **JavaScript** assignment was part of our Module 2 in the ICT 4510 curriculum. In this project, we built upon our current knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the past module, I had written some of my own JavaScript in an IIFE statement with a few public  methods that would then be rendered with one global call to the init function from the IIFEE statement. In this second assignment, we had to add more JavaScript to take the input values from each of the inputs on our web page that we had previously created and insert them into a JavaScript array literal. We then had to use a for loop and iterate through the array of input values to then export and append them to an Unordered List on the page. The document is the same form and extra Vanilla JavaScript on top of what I had written during Module 1 in this course. This assignment demoed our knowledge of how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM easier while using functions and loops with arrays. We also learned how to properly use parameters in a function to be able to continually call the function with different data anytime you would like.
