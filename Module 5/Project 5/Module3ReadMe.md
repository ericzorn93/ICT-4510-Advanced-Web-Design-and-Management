# ICT-4510-Advanced-Web-Design-and-Management: Module 2 (Forms) with JavaScript Output 9/12/17

This **JavaScript** assignment was part of our Module 3 in the ICT 4510 curriculum. In this project, we built upon our current knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the past module, I had written Vanilla JavaScript on top of the script that could have been found from the original Module 1 to take the input values of the form and export them as list items inside of an unordered list. In this third assignment, we had to expand upon the JavaScript code from last week that involved loops and arrays, buy changing and minimizing the code needed with jQuery. We used **`jQuery`** to be able to shorten and animate the amount of code that was needed for the input values in the form to be able to print properly to the DOM inside of the Jumbotron class div.
