# ICT-4510-Advanced-Web-Design-and-Management

In this class, we are understanding the new concepts of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and many of the JavaScript libraries like jQuery.We also are learning the different APIs the JavaScript and HTML5 use together. Many of these concepts are a refresher and many are new to me. HTML5 coupled with JavaScript is powerful!

These are all of the projects that I will be completing and updating throughout the course during this semester of Autumn 2017 at the University of Denver. This is part of master’s Degree that is in the University of College’s Information and Communications Technology program, with a concentration on Web Design and Development. To develop all of these applications and web pages, I am using Jet Brain’s Web Storm and PhpStorm IDEs with MAMP and the Apache server as my main stack.


****In order to run these files, you will need a local server stack like MAMP, AMPPS, and XAMPP to be able to load and render the PHP files in your HTDocs folder or other related folder.
